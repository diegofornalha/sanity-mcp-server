# Sanity MCP Server

An implementation of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for Sanity.io.

## Overview

This server implements the MCP protocol using stdio transport, making it suitable for direct integration with LLM assistants that support the MCP protocol. The server provides tools for interacting with Sanity's content management system.

## Technical Details

- Built with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Uses Vitest for testing, with better ES Modules support
- Implements controllers for various Sanity.io features:
  - `actions.ts`: Document publishing and unpublishing operations
  - `embeddings.ts`: Embeddings and semantic search
  - `groq.ts`: GROQ queries and real-time updates
  - `mutate.ts`: Document mutations and modifications
  - `releases.ts`: Content release management
  - `schema.ts`: Schema type information
  - `tools.ts`: Tool definitions for MCP

## Available Tools

The server provides the following tools:

- **GROQ Queries**

  - `query`: Executes GROQ queries (formerly `searchContent`)
  - `subscribeToUpdates`: Subscribes to real-time updates for documents
  - `getGroqSpecification`: Gets the GROQ query language specification

- **Document Retrieval**

  - `getDocument`: Gets a document by ID or multiple documents by their IDs
  - `getDocuments`: Gets multiple documents by their IDs (alternative to using `getDocument` with an array)

- **Document Mutations**

  - `createDocument`: Creates a new document
  - `updateDocument`: Updates one or more existing documents
  - `mutateDocument`: Performs multiple operations on a single document
  - `deleteDocument`: Deletes one or more documents
  - `batchMutations`: Performs multiple mutations across different documents
  - `updatePortableText`: Updates Portable Text fields (formerly `modifyPortableTextField`)

- **Document Actions**

  - `publishDocument`: Publishes one or more documents
  - `unpublishDocument`: Unpublishes one or more documents
  - `createRelease`: Creates a new content release
  - `addDocumentToRelease`: Adds a document to a content release
  - `removeDocumentFromRelease`: Removes one or more documents from a content release
  - `listReleaseDocuments`: Lists documents in a release
  - `createDocumentVersion`: Creates a version of one or more documents in a specific release
  - `unpublishDocumentWithRelease`: Marks one or more documents for unpublishing when a release is published

- **Schema Management**

  - `listSchemaTypes`: Lists available schema types
  - `getTypeSchema`: Gets detailed schema for a specific type

- **Embeddings and Semantic Search**

  - `semanticSearch`: Performs semantic search on embeddings indices
  - `listEmbeddingsIndices`: Lists available embeddings indices

- **Project Management**
  - `listOrganizationsAndProjects`: Lists all organizations and their projects
  - `listStudios`: Lists all studios for a specific project

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Building and Running

This project is built with TypeScript. To compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

> **Important**: Before running the server, make sure to set up your environment variables as described in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below. The server requires Sanity API credentials to function properly.

### Development Mode

Start the development server with automatic recompilation and restart on changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses `tsc -w` to watch TypeScript files and recompile them when they change, plus `node --watch` to restart the server when the compiled JavaScript changes.

### Production Mode

For production or regular usage:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

### Using as a direct command line tool

```bash
npm start
```

Or after building:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

### Integration with AI assistants

The server can be integrated with AI assistants that support the MCP protocol. It uses stdio transport (standard input/output) to communicate.

To see an example of how to integrate with the MCP client, check out the `usage-example.ts` file.

#### Claude AI Configuration Example

For Anthropic's Claude AI, you can configure it to use this MCP server by adding the following to your Claude configuration:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "sanity-mcp",
      "type": "mcp",
      "path": "/path/to/sanity-mcp-server/dist/index.js",
      "env": {
        "SANITY_TOKEN": "your_sanity_api_token",
        "SANITY_PROJECT_ID": "your_sanity_project_id",
        "SANITY_DATASET": "your_sanity_dataset",
        "SANITY_API_VERSION": "2025-03-15"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment Variables

To configure the server, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to create your own `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your Sanity credentials:

   ```
   SANITY_TOKEN=your_sanity_api_token
   SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id
   SANITY_DATASET=your_sanity_dataset
   SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-05-23  # Must be 2024-05-23 or later to support releases
   PORT=3000  # Server port
   ```

   You can get these values from your Sanity project settings:

   - `SANITY_TOKEN`: Create an API token in the Sanity management console with appropriate permissions
   - `SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Your Sanity project ID (found in project settings)
   - `SANITY_DATASET`: The dataset name you want to work with (typically "production")

## Development

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Source code
  - `controllers/`: Controller modules for different Sanity features
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `config/`: Configuration files
- `config/`: Configuration files for development tools
  - `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration
  - `.eslintignore`: Files to ignore in ESLint
